# Getting Started

This project is a one page React app with Calendar, To-do List, and inspirational quotes

## Dependencies

Use npm install from the main directory to download dependencies for React and Bootstrap:
    `$ npm install`

##How to use

This project is reliant upon the [Google Calendar API](https://developers.google.com/calendar/overview) to show calendar events. Create a .env file in the main directory:
    `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID='your_google_calendar_id'`
    `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_API_KEY='your_google_calendar_api_key'`


In the project directory, you can run:

### `$ npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `$ npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
